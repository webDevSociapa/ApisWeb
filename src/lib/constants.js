<p>Commenting on the campaign, Mr. Amit Anand, MD of Apis India Ltd. said, Consumers have become more aware of their health requirements in the last two years and have been actively going for healthy alternatives. With the coming winter season, the time of the year when immunity tends to weaken, we are hoping to make parents more aware by promoting this campaign. Apis India has made a reputation for itself in the FMCG sector, thanks to its incredible value proposition, a solid leadership group, and incredibly competent staff ”. As it continues to its centennial year in 2024, the brand remains to be the first choice for consumers among honey-makers who contribute to the health of millions of Indians and consumers around the world.</p>
<p>Marketing agency Sociapa who has been partners with the brand for the last 3 years and has planned and executed the campaign, says, “It feels extremely proud and honored to be a part of the brand. We are extremely hopeful that the audience will very well resonate with the brand’s ideology which is being communicated via #ShuddhAurSaccha”.</p>
<p>Apis India’s journey begins in 1924 and over the decades it had built up a reliable reputation. Since 2016 the brand has forayed into the B2C aspect with over three decades worth of experience sourcing and processing honey. The company has over 5,000 registered beekeepers across 15 states where honey is sourced from and processed at a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility spread across 7 acres in Roorkee, Uttarakhand.</p>
<p>With the growing concerns of people consuming sugar which has led to ill effects on the body, the company leveraged the benefits of honey to promote its unique Apis Himalaya Honey brand.</p>
<p>Currently, the company is positioned as one of the top three honey brands with over 4 lakh conventional retail outlets. When it comes to Apis Honey, it is easy to associate it with marking the standards of purity. Apis India holds numerous certifications promoting its purity which includes BRC Global, APEDA, NON-GMO, KOSHER, and ISO 22000 by Intertek. It is also FSSAI compliant and registered with USFDA. According to the company, its honey is also free from any additional preservatives and additives, so consumers may enjoy the pure taste of honey with its health benefits like – weight loss, protection from cold &amp; cough, improved metabolism, and rich source of antioxidants and nutrients.</p>

//             <p><strong>FIVE LIP-SMACKING SUMMER DRINKS TO MAKE WITH HONEY</strong></p>
// <p>As we welcome summer, let us beat the heat with some tasty summer beverages. Here are five selected summer drinks that are easy to prepare and good for your body.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p>Come summer, our taste buds crave for cool sips of nectareous drinks.&nbsp; While water is ofcourse the best drink to have, there can be other alternatives to quench our thirst as well as keep our bodies cool. Traditionally, we have had numerous summer drinks in our cuisine. However, with time, we have either replaced them with easily available packaged drinks or botched up the recipe with sugar, food colours, soda and what not. There are a few summer drinks which are really easy to make. Add honey to them and they become the best thing about a hot summer afternoon.</p>
// <p>Here, we share five such recipes curated especially for you and your family.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>AAM PANNA</strong></p>
// <p>The gift of summers, mangoes, can deeply satisfy your taste buds in multiple ways. A sip of aam panna signals the onset of the season and has been a traditional favourite. Here is a really easy way to concoct a glass of this tangy and sweet drink.</p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Aam Panna</strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>500 gm green mangoes</li>
// <li>2 tsp kala namak (black rock salt)</li>
// <li>2 tsp roasted and powdered cumin seeds</li>
// <li>2 Tbsp finely chopped mint leaves</li>
// <li>2 cups water</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis honey</li>
// </ul>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Take the pulp of a few raw mangoes and boil them well. Blend it with all the ingredients. Top it with a dash of Apis honey. Add a few cubes of ice and serve. Sweet, smooth summer escape!</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>SHIKANJI</strong></p>
// <p>Another hot favourite for the hot season, Shikanji is primarily consumed in north Indian homes. However, with its benefits and the ease of preparation, it should well be our national summer drink.</p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Shikanji</strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>1/4 cups mint leaves</li>
// <li>5 tbsp lemon juice</li>
// <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
// <li>1 tsp chaat masala</li>
// <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
// <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
// <li>1/2 tsp black salt</li>
// <li>2 cups water</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis honey</li>
// </ul>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Crush the mint leaves in a bowl. Add the cumin powder, black pepper, chaat masala, salt and black salt and stir all of them well in water. Add two spoon of Apis honey and serve chilled with a few ice cubes or crushed ice. Your savoury heat-respite drink is ready.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>JALJEERA</strong></p>
// <p>Another north Indian favourite that now has fans across the world. Jaljeera has a pungent flavour that hits the gustatory senses and instantly brings the body temperature down. Here is a quick and easy way to fix your drink.</p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Jaljeera</strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>125 grams oftamarind pulp</li>
// <li>3 tbsp mint leaves</li>
// <li>3 tbsp coriander leaves</li>
// <li>3/4 tsp ground cumin, roasted</li>
// <li>4 tsp black salt</li>
// <li>3-4 tbsp lemon juice</li>
// <li>A pinch of chilli powder/kashmirimirch</li>
// <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
// <li>2 cups water</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis honey</li>
// </ul>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Soak the tamarind pulp in warm water for 30 minutes. Deseed it and blend it with the mint and coriander leaves, roasted cumin, lemon juice and chilli powder. Chill it for some time in the refrigerator. Top it with Apis honey and serve chilled with a few ice cubes. Relish the strong flavour as it appeals to your soul and calms it down.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>CLASSIC SWEET LASSI</strong></p>
// <p>What started as a go-to drink in the rural homes of Punjab is today a global favourite drink for all seasons and reasons. For centuries, in every Punjabi home, curd has been stored in earthen pots. With a rise in temperature, the curd gets churned with water and served in a long, brass glass. We will stick to the tradition and top it up with Apis Rose Sharbat.</p>
// <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Lassi</strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>500 gms yogurt</li>
// <li>50 gms ice cubes</li>

// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Crush the ice cubes in a blender. Add yogurt, salt and water and blend for a minute. Add Apis Rose Sharbat and top it well. Drop a couple of ice cubes and serve chilled.</p>
// <p>Since it’s summer, you can even punch the concoction with your favourite fruit, like mango or watermelon or papaya. Just blend the pulp of the fruit and the yogurt together, top it with Apis Rose Sharbat and you have a summer favourite in your hand.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>HONEY MINT LEMONADE</strong></p>
// <p>The drink that conjures the visual of a lazy summer afternoon by the pool has to be one of the top on this chart. The honey mint lemonade is easy to make and is a light and healthy drink. It takes only 4 ingredients and can be cooked up in a jiffy.</p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Honey Mint Lemonade </strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>3-4 tbsp of lemon juice</li>
// <li>A handful of mint leaves</li>
// <li>200 ml water</li>
// <li>3-4 slices of cucumber</li>
// <li>3-4 ice cubes</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis honey</li>
// </ul>
// <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Muddle the mint leaves in a pitcher. Add the lemon juice and ice. Rest it for a while and allow it to cool. Add water and Apis honey. Drop the slices of cucumber in the glass and serve chilled. Now relax and sip the delicious summer favourite.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p>The summer heat is an opportunity to stay indoors and spend some quality time with family. Blend these drinks up with the goodness of Apis honey and Rose Sharbat. Spend a relaxed and fun afternoon with your loved ones for many summers to come.</p>
