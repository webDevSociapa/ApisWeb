            <p>Preparations amongst the Islamic community have begun as the month of Ramadan approaches. The holiest month in the Islamic calendar, Ramadan is considered as a time of worship, self-reflection and devotion to the Almighty.</p>
<p>Ramadan is a time for spiritual reflection, self-improvement and celebration. As the holy month approaches, it’s a great opportunity to focus on healthy eating and nourishing the body with wholesome foods. Conveying the importance of health and wellness, Apis avails its consumers of a host of healthy foods and ingredients to prepare delicious and nutritious recipes that will help make Ramadan special.</p>
<p>Since adherents are allowed to consume only two meals a day, they tend to make it their best meal. They have everything on their table including soft drinks to appetisers, main course to delicious sweet &amp;savouries, yet the first bite of every meal is that of dates. Apart from dates, a few staples in their diet are vermicelli, honey and Kesar. All of these ingredients can also be used to make a common yet tasty sweet dish which goes by the name Seviyan.</p>
<p>Apis has a wide selection of healthy products, including the above-mentioned items, that add a touch of sweet indulgence to favourite Ramadan meals while keeping the body and mind healthy during this holy month.</p>
<h2>Apis Dates</h2>
<p>Due to the religious &amp; cultural history, dates are mandatory in the Ramadan diet. It is believed that the prophet broke his fast with the fruit of the date palm tree and hence, dates carry a certain significance among the community.</p>
<p>Apis offers you a wide range of dates of superior quality. Royal Zahidi, Nayab dates and Arabian Pearls are some of the most popular among the same. Alongside various cultural reasons, eating dates do have scientific importance as well. Apis dates are rich in energy-boosting nutrients which keep you energised during your fast. These are also rich in antioxidants which keep your heart functions maintained.</p>
<p>Apart from eating dates during sehri and iftar, dates are a symbol of goodness and generosity, people of the Islamic faith gift each other dates as an expression of love and respect.</p>
<h2>Apis Honey</h2>
<p>When it comes to natural sweeteners, honey stands out as one of the healthiest options available. Apis Honey, in particular, has gained a reputation for its purity and high nutritional value. It is widely regarded as one of the best honey brands in the market.</p>
<p>Not only is it carefully harvested and packaged, but it also undergoes rigorous quality control measures to ensure that it remains pure and unadulterated. Apis honey can be added in sweets and savouries, it’s not only a healthier option than refined sugar but also adds flavour to all favourite delicacies.</p>
<h2>Apis Vermicelli</h2>
<p>To make the most of vermicelli’s versatility during Ramadan, it is important to choose the right variety for the dish you are preparing. Apis Vermicelli’s fine and smooth texture is perfect for sweet dishes like sheer khurma and vermicelli kheer, while Apis Roasted Vermicelli’s slightly nutty flavour is best for savoury dishes like upma. Whether you’re cooking up a sweet sehri or a savoury iftar, vermicelli is a great ingredient to have on hand.</p>
<h2>Apis Kesar</h2>
<p>Kesar is considered to be one of the most expensive spices in the world and is known for its taste and health benefits. It is also considered an important ingredient in Islamic medicine. Apis Kesar is harvested from the crop of the finest quality flower, with each shard handpicked and packed carefully for consumers.</p>
<p>By adding Apis Kesar to your sweets during Ramadan, you can enjoy its rich flavour and numerous health benefits.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Muslims worldwide observe Ramadan as the sacred month of fasting and prayer. It is a time of spiritual reflection, self-discipline, and strengthening one’s faith and connection with Allah. It is also a time of social gatherings and celebrations, with families and friends coming together to break their fasts and share meals during Iftar.

//             <p><strong>FIVE LIP-SMACKING SUMMER DRINKS TO MAKE WITH HONEY</strong></p>
// <p>As we welcome summer, let us beat the heat with some tasty summer beverages. Here are five selected summer drinks that are easy to prepare and good for your body.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p>Come summer, our taste buds crave for cool sips of nectareous drinks.&nbsp; While water is ofcourse the best drink to have, there can be other alternatives to quench our thirst as well as keep our bodies cool. Traditionally, we have had numerous summer drinks in our cuisine. However, with time, we have either replaced them with easily available packaged drinks or botched up the recipe with sugar, food colours, soda and what not. There are a few summer drinks which are really easy to make. Add honey to them and they become the best thing about a hot summer afternoon.</p>
// <p>Here, we share five such recipes curated especially for you and your family.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>AAM PANNA</strong></p>
// <p>The gift of summers, mangoes, can deeply satisfy your taste buds in multiple ways. A sip of aam panna signals the onset of the season and has been a traditional favourite. Here is a really easy way to concoct a glass of this tangy and sweet drink.</p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Aam Panna</strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>500 gm green mangoes</li>
// <li>2 tsp kala namak (black rock salt)</li>
// <li>2 tsp roasted and powdered cumin seeds</li>
// <li>2 Tbsp finely chopped mint leaves</li>
// <li>2 cups water</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis honey</li>
// </ul>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Take the pulp of a few raw mangoes and boil them well. Blend it with all the ingredients. Top it with a dash of Apis honey. Add a few cubes of ice and serve. Sweet, smooth summer escape!</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>SHIKANJI</strong></p>
// <p>Another hot favourite for the hot season, Shikanji is primarily consumed in north Indian homes. However, with its benefits and the ease of preparation, it should well be our national summer drink.</p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Shikanji</strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>1/4 cups mint leaves</li>
// <li>5 tbsp lemon juice</li>
// <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
// <li>1 tsp chaat masala</li>
// <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
// <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
// <li>1/2 tsp black salt</li>
// <li>2 cups water</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis honey</li>
// </ul>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Crush the mint leaves in a bowl. Add the cumin powder, black pepper, chaat masala, salt and black salt and stir all of them well in water. Add two spoon of Apis honey and serve chilled with a few ice cubes or crushed ice. Your savoury heat-respite drink is ready.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>JALJEERA</strong></p>
// <p>Another north Indian favourite that now has fans across the world. Jaljeera has a pungent flavour that hits the gustatory senses and instantly brings the body temperature down. Here is a quick and easy way to fix your drink.</p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Jaljeera</strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>125 grams oftamarind pulp</li>
// <li>3 tbsp mint leaves</li>
// <li>3 tbsp coriander leaves</li>
// <li>3/4 tsp ground cumin, roasted</li>
// <li>4 tsp black salt</li>
// <li>3-4 tbsp lemon juice</li>
// <li>A pinch of chilli powder/kashmirimirch</li>
// <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
// <li>2 cups water</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis honey</li>
// </ul>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Soak the tamarind pulp in warm water for 30 minutes. Deseed it and blend it with the mint and coriander leaves, roasted cumin, lemon juice and chilli powder. Chill it for some time in the refrigerator. Top it with Apis honey and serve chilled with a few ice cubes. Relish the strong flavour as it appeals to your soul and calms it down.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>CLASSIC SWEET LASSI</strong></p>
// <p>What started as a go-to drink in the rural homes of Punjab is today a global favourite drink for all seasons and reasons. For centuries, in every Punjabi home, curd has been stored in earthen pots. With a rise in temperature, the curd gets churned with water and served in a long, brass glass. We will stick to the tradition and top it up with Apis Rose Sharbat.</p>
// <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Lassi</strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>500 gms yogurt</li>
// <li>50 gms ice cubes</li>
// <li>A pinch of salt</li>
// <li>200 ml water</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis Rose Sharbat</li>
// </ul>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Crush the ice cubes in a blender. Add yogurt, salt and water and blend for a minute. Add Apis Rose Sharbat and top it well. Drop a couple of ice cubes and serve chilled.</p>
// <p>Since it’s summer, you can even punch the concoction with your favourite fruit, like mango or watermelon or papaya. Just blend the pulp of the fruit and the yogurt together, top it with Apis Rose Sharbat and you have a summer favourite in your hand.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p><strong>HONEY MINT LEMONADE</strong></p>
// <p>The drink that conjures the visual of a lazy summer afternoon by the pool has to be one of the top on this chart. The honey mint lemonade is easy to make and is a light and healthy drink. It takes only 4 ingredients and can be cooked up in a jiffy.</p>
// <p><strong>Ingredients of Honey Mint Lemonade </strong></p>
// <ul>
// <li>3-4 tbsp of lemon juice</li>
// <li>A handful of mint leaves</li>
// <li>200 ml water</li>
// <li>3-4 slices of cucumber</li>
// <li>3-4 ice cubes</li>
// <li>2 spoonful of Apis honey</li>
// </ul>
// <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
// <p><strong>Method of preparation</strong></p>
// <p>Muddle the mint leaves in a pitcher. Add the lemon juice and ice. Rest it for a while and allow it to cool. Add water and Apis honey. Drop the slices of cucumber in the glass and serve chilled. Now relax and sip the delicious summer favourite.</p>
// <p>&nbsp;</p>
// <p>The summer heat is an opportunity to stay indoors and spend some quality time with family. Blend these drinks up with the goodness of Apis honey and Rose Sharbat. Spend a relaxed and fun afternoon with your loved ones for many summers to come.</p>
